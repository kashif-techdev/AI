## ðŸ§¹ Goal-Based Vacuum Cleaner

This is a simple **AI simulation** of a goal-based vacuum cleaner agent built using Python.
The agent moves around a grid environment, detects **dirty rooms**, and cleans them while avoiding **hurdles** â€” stopping once all rooms are clean.

### ðŸš€ Features

* Randomly generated grid environment
* Agent decision-making using goal-based rules
* Handles obstacles (hurdles)
* Step-by-step simulation output in the console

### ðŸ§  Concepts Used

* Artificial Intelligence (Goal-Based Agent)
* Decision-making based on environment perception

### ðŸ§© Example Output

```
Step 1:
[A] [D] [C]
[C] [H] [C]
[C] [C] [D]

Cleaning at [0,0]
Moved to [0,1]
...
All rooms are clean. Stopping.
```
