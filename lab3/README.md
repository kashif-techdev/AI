ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Agent

This is a simple Python program that simulates an AI Traffic Light Agent.
The agent observes the color of a traffic light and decides what action to take based on simple rules.

ðŸ§  How It Works

The user enters a traffic light color: red, yellow, or green.

The agent responds with the correct action:

ðŸŸ¥ Red â†’ Stop

ðŸŸ¨ Yellow â†’ Slow down

ðŸŸ© Green â†’ Go

Type exit to stop the simulation.

ðŸ’» Run the Program
python traffic_light_agent.py

ðŸ§© Example Output
Enter the traffic light color (red, yellow, green or exit to stop the simulation): red
Action: Stop

Enter the traffic light color (red, yellow, green or exit to stop the simulation): green
Action: Go

Enter the traffic light color (red, yellow, green or exit to stop the simulation): exit

ðŸ§  Concept

This project demonstrates basic rule-based AI and agent perception-action behavior â€” a foundational concept in Artificial Intelligence.
